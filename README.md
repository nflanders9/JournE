# JournE
Have you ever had a favorite song come on just as you were about to get out of the car? JournE is a web app that creates a playlist with just the exact amount of time of your trip so that the song ends just as you get out of the car. No more needing to sit in the car for your favorite song to finish or leave during the middle of it.

Simply enter a group of keywords describing the music you want to listen to, your starting location, your ending location, and the way in which you plan to get there and journey will create a custom playlist specifically designed to end when your trip does.

This project was made as part of the Make BU 2015 hackathon.

A version of this project is hosted at nflanders9.github.io/JournE/landing.html
